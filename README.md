# üß© Stape GTM Helper ‚Äì Chrome Extension

A developer-focused extension to streamline your workflow with Google Tag Manager.

> **Note:** Documentation and features coming soon.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

You can use any Node.js package manager ‚Äì I recommend **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** for speed and simplicity.

### Install & Run

```bash
cd extension_folder
bun install
bun run dev         # For Chromium
bun run dev:firefox # For Firefox
```

This will launch a local version of the chosen browser with the extension automatically loaded. By default, it will open [tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com).
Popup Windows is now using VUE3 and HRM.
